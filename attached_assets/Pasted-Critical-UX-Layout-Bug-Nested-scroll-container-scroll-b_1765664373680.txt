Critical UX / Layout Bug — Nested scroll container + scroll blocking (confirmed on live site)

I reviewed the live site and confirmed the issue:

The page has TWO vertical scroll contexts:

Browser/body scrollbar (far right)

An inner scroll container wrapping the main content

Because of this:

It feels like there are two pages

Mouse wheel / touch scroll fails or moves only a few pixels when the cursor is over cards (prayer times, tables, countdowns)

Scrolling only works reliably when the cursor is on empty background

This is not a device issue — it’s a layout/CSS issue.

Root Cause (what’s actually wrong)

There is a page-level wrapper (likely main, #root, or a layout div) that has both:

height: 100vh (or h-screen)

overflow-y: auto / scroll

At the same time, body is also scrollable.

➡️ This creates nested scrolling, and inner elements capture the scroll wheel / touch events.

Required Fix (this will solve it)
1) Enforce ONE scroll only — the browser (body)

Body must be the only scroll container.

html,
body {
  height: auto;
  min-height: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: auto;
}

2) REMOVE scrolling from all layout wrappers (mandatory)

Find the main layout wrapper (examples):

main

#root

.app

.page

.container

any wrapper around the entire page content

❌ REMOVE these if present:

height: 100vh

h-screen

overflow-y: auto

overflow: scroll

✅ Replace with:

min-height: 100vh;
overflow: visible;


This is the most important fix.

3) Cards / tables must NOT be scroll containers

Prayer time cards and tables currently trap scroll events.

Ensure:

No card/table/container has:

overflow: auto

overflow-y: auto

fixed heights that force inner scrolling

If horizontal scrolling is needed anywhere:

overflow-x: auto;
overflow-y: visible;

4) Fix pointer/touch behavior globally (important)

Some elements are intercepting input.

Add globally:

body {
  touch-action: pan-y;
}


Ensure no element has:

touch-action: none;


unless absolutely required.

5) Check Framer Motion / gesture handlers

If any container uses Framer Motion:

Make sure drag is NOT enabled

Remove onPan, onDrag, or pointer handlers from page-level components

These can silently block scroll.

Acceptance Criteria (non-negotiable)

Only one scrollbar visible

Scrolling works anywhere, including directly on:

prayer time cards

tables

countdown cards

No “dead zones” where scroll stops

Works on desktop mouse wheel + mobile touch

Why this matters

This issue makes the site feel:

broken

heavy

unpolished

Even if everything else is perfect, nested scroll kills UX immediately.
