Update Qiblah UI/UX in the "القبلة" tab.

CURRENT PROBLEM
- The Kaaba/qiblah icon is attached to the rotating red line. That’s wrong UX.
- The qiblah target should be a fixed marker on the compass ring, and the phone heading line rotates until it points to that target.
- Also the user needs clear “يمين/يسار” guidance (nearest turn direction) while not aligned, and it must disappear once aligned.

TARGET UX (like a real compass)
1) The compass circle stays centered.
2) The phone heading indicator (red line) rotates based on device heading.
3) The qiblah target marker (Kaaba icon) is positioned ON the compass ring at the correct bearing angle to Mecca (relative to North), independent from the phone heading line.
4) The user rotates the phone until the red line aligns with the qiblah marker.
5) Show a simple hint near the red line while NOT aligned:
   - “لف يمين” or “لف يسار” (nearest direction)
   - Optionally show degrees remaining (e.g., 12°)
6) When aligned (within tolerance), hide the direction hint completely (no arrows, no “يمين/يسار”), and show a subtle “✅ أنت على القبلة” or a small “تم” state.

MATH / LOGIC (must be correct)
- Compute:
  qiblahBearing = bearing from user location (lat/lng) to Kaaba (21.4225, 39.8262) in degrees 0..360
- Get:
  heading = device heading (0..360), where 0 = North
- UI:
  - Qiblah marker position is based on qiblahBearing (fixed target).
  - Heading line rotation is based on heading.
- Alignment:
  delta = shortestAngleDifference(heading, qiblahBearing) => range -180..+180
  absDelta = Math.abs(delta)
  aligned if absDelta <= tolerance (set tolerance = 3° or 5°)
- Nearest turn hint:
  - If not aligned:
    - If delta > 0 => user should rotate RIGHT (clockwise) to reduce delta => show "لف يمين"
    - If delta < 0 => show "لف يسار"
  - Also show "متبقي X°" where X = absDelta rounded.
  - Once aligned: hide the hint completely.

UI IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Place qiblah marker on the ring:
  - Use absolute positioning inside the compass container.
  - Convert qiblahBearing to angle in radians relative to top (North at top):
    angleRad = (qiblahBearing - 90) * (Math.PI/180)   // if your coordinate system uses 0° at +X, adjust accordingly
  - Position:
    x = centerX + radius * cos(angleRad)
    y = centerY + radius * sin(angleRad)
  - Use a slight offset so icon sits nicely on ring (not outside).
- Heading line:
  - Use CSS transform rotate(headingDeg) around center.
  - Ensure the line points to 0° at top.
- Direction hint placement:
  - Render the hint near the tip of the red line or slightly above it.
  - It must not cover the qiblah marker.
  - When aligned, the hint is removed.

UX POLISH
- Add a subtle snap/feedback when aligned:
  - Haptic on mobile if available (optional).
  - Or change the ring glow color slightly when aligned.
- Keep it readable:
  - Large tap/visual sizes.
  - Minimal text.
- No clutter: only show “لف يمين/يسار + المتبقي” when needed.
- If device orientation/heading permission is missing:
  - Show a clear CTA: “فعّل إذن البوصلة” with steps.
  - Don’t show wrong compass.

DELIVERABLE
- Refactor the Qiblah compass so Kaaba marker is a fixed target on the ring, red line rotates with heading.
- Add smart left/right guidance (nearest turn) that disappears when aligned.
- Ensure alignment math uses shortest angle difference (no wrong direction near 0/360 wrap).
