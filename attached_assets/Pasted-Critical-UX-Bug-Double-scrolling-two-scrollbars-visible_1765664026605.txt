Critical UX Bug — Double scrolling / two scrollbars visible

On desktop (and some mobile views), the website shows two vertical scrollbars (one at the far right and another inner scroll). This makes it feel like there are two pages or two scrolling areas, which is very confusing and breaks UX.

You should have ONE scroll only (the browser window).

What’s causing this (very likely)

One of these is happening:

An inner container (layout / page wrapper / main) has:

height: 100vh and

overflow-y: auto or overflow: scroll

Both body and an inner wrapper are scrollable.

A layout component (AppLayout / Page / Main) is creating its own scroll context.

This is why the far-right scrollbar appears.

Required Fix (must do)
1) Enforce single scroll source

Only ONE element should scroll: body

✅ Do this globally:

html,
body {
  height: auto;
  min-height: 100%;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  overflow-y: auto;
}


🚫 Do NOT allow scrolling on:

#root

main

page wrappers

cards

layout containers

2) Remove inner scroll containers

Search the project for:

overflow-y: auto

overflow: auto

overflow: scroll

h-screen

height: 100vh

If used on a page-level container, remove them.

✅ Page wrapper should be:

main {
  min-height: 100%;
  overflow: visible;
}


🚫 Avoid:

height: 100vh;
overflow-y: auto;


This is the #1 cause of “two scrollbars”.

3) Fix layout height logic (important)

If you need full-height layouts, use min-height, not height:

✅ Correct:

min-height: 100vh;


🚫 Wrong (causes double scroll):

height: 100vh;

4) Check sticky / fixed elements

If you have:

sticky headers

fixed nav bars

tab bars

Make sure they do NOT sit inside a scrollable container.
They must be inside the normal document flow.

Acceptance criteria

Only one scrollbar visible (browser scrollbar).

No inner scrolling anywhere.

Scrolling feels continuous and natural.

No “second page” feeling on the right.

UX principle (important)

Users should never choose where to scroll.
The page should scroll the same way everywhere.

This fix is high priority because double scrolling kills perceived quality immediately.
